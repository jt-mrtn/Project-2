        <h3>About &nbsp;JT</h3>
        <p>I began my career as a professional musician performing in Europe and USA. I play classical and Irish traditional styles on flutes and whistles. I also like gardening, kayaking, riding bikes, hiking, skiing (XC & downhill), and running.</p>
        <p>Eventually, my mathematically-curious brain led me to explore how computers do all of this magic. So naturally, I became a programmer. In doing so, I realized how similar to ensemble musicianship it is.</p>
        <p>As a software developer, I strive to reach timely and elegant solutions for my team's needs just as I would deliver a phrase in tune, harmony and tempo to the rest of the band. Programmers affect people's work lives so I take the role of agile team-player very seriously. We programmers stand on lofty shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>I was a report writer and software applications developer at the Smithsonian for 12 years. I gained lots of enthusiasm for programming, especially for the web, so I sought out <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" title="Open separate page for Thinkful" target="\_blank">Thinkful</a> to hone those skills even further. So far, so good! So let's get going on some exciting projects - together!</p>
