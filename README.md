# project-2
## Portfolio Website -
This is the first website I've created for a public audience. It was begun in partial fulfillment of Thinkful's Software Engineering course. I've since moved on to other things. I'm now exploring creative coding and will be uploading my projects here.

This site contains the following pages:
* Home
* About
* Projects (with links to other pages)
* Contact

[See the website here](https://jt-martin.com/).
